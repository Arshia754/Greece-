      <p>Ancient Greek mythology is a vast and fascinating group of legends about gods and goddesses, heroes and monsters, warriors and fools, that were an important part of everyday life in the ancient world. Greek myths explained everything from religious rituals to the weather, and gave meaning to the world that people saw around them. While many of these myths are fanciful tales, such as the legends of King Midas, heroic Hercules, or other stories like the Trojan War.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>In the beginning there was only Chaos, the gaping emptiness. Then came three more imortal terrors, Gaea (Earth), Tartarus (the Underworld) and Eros (Love). Once Love was there, Gaea and Chaos were able to procreate and shape everything known and unknown in the universe. <br>Chaos gave birth to Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night). Erebus had Aether, the bright upper air and Hemera the Day. Night a family of forces all by herself. Her children included the hateful Moros (Fate), the black Ker (Doom), Thanatos (Death), Hypnos (Sleep), Oneiroi (Dreams), Geras (Old Age), Oizus (Pain), Nemesis (Revenge), Eris (Strife), Apate (Deceit), Momos (Blame) and the Hesperides (the Daughters of the Evening). <br>Meanwhile Gaea gave birth to Uranus the Starry Sky. Uranus became Gaea's husband surrounding her from all sides. They had three sets of children, the three one-eyed Cyclopes, the three Hundred-Handed Hecatoncheires and the twelve Titans.

      <h2>The 12 titans</h2>
      <p>The Titans were the lords in Greek mythology that ruled before the Olympians. They were the children of Uranus and Gaea. The Titans included Oceanus, Tethys, Hyperion, Theia, Coeus, Phoebe, Cronus, Rhea, Mnemosyne, Themis, Crius and Iapetus. Cronus was the leader of the Titans after he managed to overthrow his tyrant father Uranus from the throne. Cronus later learned of a prophecy that said his son would eventually overthrow him and did everything he could to prevent it. However, the prophecy came true and Zeus managed to dethrone him and end the age of the Titans after the Titanomachy which was the great war between Titans and Olympians.

      <h2>The 12 Olympians</h2>
      <p>In Greek mythology the Olympians were the major gods who Ancient Greeks believed in. The Olympians were twelve and had Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes and either Hestia or Dionysus. Their name Olympians originates from Mount Olympus which was their place of living, although sometimes Hades and Persephone were included in the Olympians but they should be excluded because they lived in the underworld.</p>
