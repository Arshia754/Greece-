    <h2>Acropolis of Athens</h2>
    <p>The Acropolis is the most important ancient site in the Western world. Crowned by the Parthenon, it stands over the city of Athens, visible from almost everywhere within. Its monuments and sanctuaries of white Pentelic marble gleam in the midday sun and gradually take on a honey hue as the sun sinks, while at night they stand brilliantly illuminated above the city. A glimpse of this magnificent sight cannot fail to exalt your spirit.</p>

    <h2>Parthenon</h2>
      <p>Built on its highest ground of the Acropolis, the Parthenon had a vital purpose, to house the great statue of Athena by Pericles, and to serve as the new treasury. It was built on the site of at least three earlier temples dedicated to Athena.

The temple consisted of eight Doric columns at either end and 17 on each side. To achieve its perfect form, its lines were curved to create an optical illusion. Supervised by Pheidias, the sculptors worked on the architectural detail of the Parthenon, including the pediments and friezes, which were brightly coloured and gilded.</p>

      <h2>Meteora</h2>
      <p>Few kilometers northwest of the town of Kalabaka, the impressive rocks of Meteora are rising from the plains of Thessaly been one of the most amazing places in Greece. Many centuries ago, on these gigantic rocks with the breathtaking landscape reaching heights of more than 600 meters, it was formed one of the most important monastic communities of Greece. The Greek word Meteora means “suspended in the air” and this phrase describes these remarkable Greek Orthodox monasteries.</p>

      <h2>Temple of Zeus</h2>
      <p>The Temple of Olympian Zeus was a magnificent temple that was built in honor of the Greek god, Zeus, the father of the gods and man, who resided on the summit of Mt Olympus. The temple is also known as the Olympieion and the Temple of Olympian Zeus. Building this huge temple took seven centuries to complete. Work began during the period of the tyrant Peisistratos in the sixth century BC, with the aim of building the largest temple in Ancient Greece.

The temple is well worth visiting as it was the largest temple ever built in the ancient world and its sheer size was awe-inspiring. The Temple of Olympian Zeus is situated just south-east of the Acropolis, within easy walking distance of the city center and is certainly one of the most magnificent ancient monuments in Athens.</p>
